# SportRadarTest

# "Thank you very much for reading. 

# Next, I will explain some small guidelines that need to be followed for the proper functioning of the application and tests. 
# Currently, the application can run without any problems by clicking on 'Run as' and selecting 'Main' using Eclipse or another programming environment. In my case, I used Eclipse. 
# Once the application is started, a series of messages will be displayed for the user to interact with. It's quite simple; you just need to use the keyboard buttons to select the desired option.

# To run the TESTS created by JUNIT5, you will need to make some small code changes by commenting and uncommenting. This is because I used the 'Scanner' class from java.util for user interaction. I decided to do it this way to prevent unnecessary project lengthening. The only changes to make are in the 'TeamUtils.java' class: comment out lines 17 and 31, and uncomment lines 18 and 30. In the 'MatchRepositoryImpl.java' class, comment out lines 50 and 56, and uncomment lines 51 and 57. Once these changes are made, you can click on 'Run as' -> 'test,' and the tests will run.

# Thank you very much for your attention; I hope you enjoy it, and we can discuss the application together soon. 
# Best regards.
